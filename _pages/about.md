Iâ€™m fascinated by the complexities of the human mind - in both order and disorder. I hold a PhD in neuroscience from the Donders Institute in the Netherlands and currently serve as the Carl Zeiss Professor at the [Laboratory for Mental Health Mapping](https://mhm-lab.github.io), Friedrich Schiller University Jena (Germany). You can follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/thomaswolfers.bsky.social).

A few times a year, I travel through Thuringia to engage with people beyond the university. In a world of rapid change, I believe academics have a responsibility to foster public dialogue. I offer pro bono talks and discussions (covering my own expenses) on:

1. **AI & machine learning**  
2. **Brain health, development & aging**  
3. **Mental health**

If you'd like to invite me to your school, community, or organization, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com).  
Please include:

- The **reason for the invitation**
