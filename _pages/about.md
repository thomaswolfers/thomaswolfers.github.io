I am fascinated by the complexities of our mind in (dis)order. I hold a PhD in neuroscience from the Donders Institute in the Netherlands and currently serve as the Carl Zeiss Professor at the [Laboratory for Mental Health Mapping](https://mhm-lab.github.io) at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena (Germany). You can follow me on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/thomaswolfers.bsky.social).
